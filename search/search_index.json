It\u2019s similar, but different math applies. Thankfully, the math for PIDs is usually done for us by the motors (or motor controllers) themselves. We just need to set the P, I, and D values More info on PIDs: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-pid.html   </p>"},{"location":"3/3.5/","title":"3.5 Motor Object","text":"<p>Similar to how we have Java classes/objects for Subsystems, we need a class for motors Lucky for us, this coding has already been done by companies like REV Robotics and CTRE Figure out which company made your motor/motor controller (if its not on the chart, look it up): https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/can-devices/third-party-devices.html  If your team is deciding between motor options for your next season I would always say shoot for Kraken X60s or Kraken X44s even at a higher price point The CTRE ecosystem is very user friendly Advanced motion control software These motors have incredible performance. All of the top teams use them because of this. Neo 550s may be $30, but the motor controller you need to control them is $100 (2025 numbers) If its CTRE, you likely use a TalonFX motor object: https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/java/com/ctre/phoenix6/hardware/TalonFX.html  If its REV, you likely use a Spark MAX motor object: https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/spark/sparkmax  It could also be a Talon SRX, Victor SPX, or SPARK Flex You will need to use the API Documentation corresponding to your motor for the following slides Before we can create a motor object, we need to install the vendor libraries for that motor To do this, go to the vendor dependencies tab on the left sidebar in VSCode Install CTRE Pheonix-6 or REVLib Before creating a motor object, we need the device ID or CAN ID (if you don\u2019t have a robot, make it up!) To find the CAN ID, you will need to open the software for your vendor For CTRE it is called Pheonix Tuner X (very nice software) For REV it is called the REV Hardware Client Download this software, open it, and power on your robot For CTRE you can just connect to your robot\u2019s network For REV you will need to connect to your PDH or motor controller via USB In the software you should see a list of motors/motor controllers/sensors If they aren\u2019t named, you can usually \u2018blink\u2019 motors by pressing a \u2018blink\u2019 button This will make the LED on the motor blink so you can tell which motor is which You will also be able to view and modify CAN IDs here Make sure each motor has a unique CAN ID Note down the CAN ID(s) for the motor(s) for your specific mechanism Go back to your code and open Constants.Java Create a subclass called \u201cCanIDs\u201d Create a constant for your CAN ID Now create an instance field in your subsystem for you motor object The parameter of the motor constructor should be the constant of the CAN ID Keep in mind, some motors are not connected to the default Can Bus Some are on a separate CAN loop such as a CANivore If you are unsure about this, ask someone who worked on the electronics on your team If the motor is not on the main CAN bus, you will need to specify the CAN bus name in the motor constructor as well (the name can be found in the vendor software) In the subsystem constructor, you will have to configure the motor The best practice on this vary by vendor (see documentation) Typically, you want to configure: Motor invert (if you don\u2019t know, you can find out later by running the motor carefully) Current limit (this will come back to bite you later if you don\u2019t set it. Generally aim for 30 amps. CTRE docs on this.) Neutral mode should be set to brake (when not in brake mode, mechanisms will go limp) Configuring PID constants will be discussed later CTRE example: Note that kG is the feed forward that resists gravity If you are using MotionMagic, you will also need to tune acceleration and cruise velocity later Some mechanisms have two (or more; looking at you 2910) motors powering the same element (this allows for snappier motion) If this is the case: define another motor Call the first one \u201clead\u201d Call the second one \u201cfollower\u201d In the constructor, configure the follower to be a follower to the lead (vendors make it easy to do this, it\u2019s usually a simple configuration) Sometimes the motors need to rotate in opposite directions to power the same mechanism In this case, make sure to set them as inverted in the configuration It\u2019s good practice to have a setVoltage method in every subsystem This way, you can set the voltage to 0 when necessary Create the setVoltage method with a \u2018volts\u2019 parameter and find your motor object\u2019s setVoltage method and call it in your setVoltage method  </p>"},{"location":"3/3.6/","title":"3.6 Creating a Subsystem","text":"<p>Go to the corresponding section for the subsystem you chose 3.6.A: Linear Mechanism (Elevator, ect.) 3.6.B: Angular Pos Mechanism (Arm, ect.) 3.6.C: Angular Vel Mechanism (Intake, ect.)

There are multiple options for this, but I would suggest a \u2018MotionMagicVoltage\u2019 request When you give the motor a number, you are not telling it what height the elevator should go to (the motor doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s attached to an elevator) Instead, you give it motor rotations This means that if we want a method that takes in the height as a parameter, we need to convert height to motor rotations There are two import factors in this conversion, winch (or pulley) circumference and gear ratio This is generally the formula you will use for the conversion (pulley and winch diameters are interchangeable mathematically) Put these constants in your ElevatorConstants class in Constants You will most likely need to talk to the designer of your robot arm to get the gear ratio Note that \u2018INCHES_TO_MOTOR_ROT\u2019 should be multiplied by the number of inches you want the elevator reach to get the number of motor rotations Now write the method to set the height of the elevator It should take in the height you want the elevator to go to It should scale that to the rotations the motor should go to It should tell the motor to go to that position Quick safety measure:  add a constant for your elevator max height (make sure to label the constant as being in inches) Use MathUtil.clamp to clamp the inches parameter between 0 and the max height This will prevent your elevator from trying to go to an unreasonable position If you know how, you might even want to log a warning when the height is being clamped (or use System.out.println()) We will discuss how to log warnings later CTRE example: The core functionality is now done. In theory, we should be able to move the elevator There is still an issue When the motor wakes up after you turn on the robot, it assumes it is at zero position Sometimes, the robot can be turned on when the motor is not at zero position In this situation, we need a way to tell the elevator motor that it is at zero position after turning it on (this is typically called \u201czeroing\u201d.   One might say \u201cI zeroed the robot; we are ready for the match\u201d) Some robots use Time of Flight (ToF) sensors to sense the position of the elevator at all times. If your robot has one, you can ignore it for now, but you may want to add that functionality in later. Most motors have a setPosition or a setSensorPosition method Make a method in your Elevator class called \u2018resetSensorPosition\u2019 Make it set the motor/sensor position to zero Another method you may want is \u2018setNeutralMode\u2019 with a parameter for the neutral mode (brake or coast) This will set the motor config to have a selected neutral mode This is very useful for when a technician wants to freely move a robot mechanism around while the robot is disabled Write the \u2018setNeutralMode\u2019 method Here is an example of the setNeutralMode method for CTRE It returns a boolean for whether the status of the motor is okay For the angular position mechanism slides I am going to refer to an arm If you aren\u2019t using an arm, replace where I say \u2018arm\u2019 with whatever your mechanism is Set your PID to a low P (0.02) and 0 for I and D for now in the constructor where you configure the motor If using CTRE, also set motion magic config: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/device-specific/talonfx/motion-magic.html  Now we need a method to set the angle of the arm  There is usually a method of the motor object you can call to set the motor position For CTRE, you need to give it a control request. There are multiple options for this, but I would suggest a \u2018MotionMagicVoltage\u2019 request Add a GEAR_RATIO constant to an ArmConstants class in Constants You will most likely need to talk to the designer of your robot arm to get the gear ratio You can configure your motor to know what the gear ratio is: This allows us to put in the arm angle we want into the \u2018setControl\u2019 motor method Now write the method to set the angle of the arm For the parameter of the angle, use a Rotation2d object It should tell the motor to go to that position Quick safety measure:  Most arms have a min and max angle (unless there is a turret involved) If so, add Rotation2d constants for the min and max angle (you get to choose where \u0472=0\u00b0) Clamp the angle parameter of the method using MathUtil.clamp This will prevent your arm from trying to go to an unreasonable position If you know how, you might even want to log a warning when the angle is being clamped (or use System.out.println()) We will discuss how to log warnings later If your angular position mechanism doesn\u2019t have a min and max angle (aka it\u2019s a turret):  You can pretend the min and max angles are 0 and 360 degrees for now, or Try continuous wrap with CTRE: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/device-specific/talonfx/closed-loop-requests.html  REV Robotics most likely has similar functionality CTRE example: The core functionality is now done. In theory, we should be able to turn the arm There is still an issue When the motor wakes up after you turn on the robot, it assumes it is at zero position Sometimes, the robot can be turned on when the motor is not at zero position In this situation, we need a way to tell the arm motor where zero actually is (this is typically called \u201czeroing\u201d. One might say \u201cI zeroed the robot; we are ready for the match\u201d) The core functionality is now done. In theory, we should be able to turn the arm There is still an issue When the motor wakes up after you turn on the robot, it assumes it is at zero position Sometimes, the robot can be turned on when the motor is not at zero position In this situation, we need a way to tell the arm motor where zero actually is (this is typically called \u201czeroing\u201d. One might say \u201cI zeroed the robot; we are ready for the match\u201d) Some mechanisms use magnetic encoders which can keep track of the mechanism position even after the robot is turned off: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/hardware-reference/cancoder/index.html  This is why you don\u2019t need to zero swerve modules  If your mechanism has a magnetic encoder, you can ignore it for now, but you will want to add that functionality in later Most motors have a setPosition or a setSensorPosition method Make a method in your Arm class called \u2018resetSensorPosition\u2019 Make it set the motor/sensor position to the min angle constant (or whatever angle you prefer to zero it to) Another method you may want is \u2018setNeutralMode\u2019 with a parameter for the neutral mode (brake or coast) This will set the motor config to have a selected neutral mode This is very useful for when a technician wants to freely move a robot mechanism around while the robot is disabled Write the \u2018setNeutralMode\u2019 method Here is an example of the setNeutralMode method for CTRE It returns a boolean for whether the status of the motor is okay For the angular velocity mechanism slides I am going to refer to an intake If you aren\u2019t using an intake, replace where I say \u2018intake\u2019 with whatever your mechanism is Many teams simply set a voltage for their intake (or flywheel) to run at when intaking and shooting gamepieces They then tune that voltage based on how gamepieces react There are a couple major flaws When resistance comes to a voltage controlled mechanism, it will slow the mechanism. We want consistent speed. Controlling things with velocity allows us to have fine control over its speed rather than guessing with voltage There are situations where you may want open loop voltage control (e.g. grabbing algae off the reef in 2025). However, these are pretty niche. For velocity control, you can\u2019t use the same exact logic as you do for a PID Let\u2019s say your velocity is 500 RPM and you want it to be 1000 RPM With a PID, you take the difference and multiply by a constant to get the motor output (ignoring I and D) But imagine what happens as we get closer to 1000 RPM The motor output becomes zero Unfortunately, because of friction and other factors, this means we would never actually reach 1000 RPM The solution to this problem is an SVAP The P constant means the same thing it did in a PID The most important constants in velocity control are V and P The V factor is feedforward V is basically multiplied by the target velocity and added to the total voltage https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-feedforward.html#introduction-to-dc-motor-feedforward  Set your SVAP to a low V (0.02) and 0 for S, A, and P for now in the constructor where you configure the motor If using CTRE, also set motion magic config: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/device-specific/talonfx/motion-magic.html  Now we need a method to set the velocity of the intake  There is usually a method of the motor object you can call to set the motor velocity For CTRE, you need to give it a control request. There are multiple options for this, but I would suggest a \u2018MotionMagicVelocityVoltage\u2019 request Add a GEAR_RATIO constant to an IntakeConstants class in Constants You will most likely need to talk to the designer of your robot intake to get the gear ratio You can configure your motor to know what the gear ratio is: This allows us to put in the intake velocity we want into the \u2018setControl\u2019 motor method Now write the method to set the velocity of the intake  You will want the input of the method to be in rotations per minute and the input to the motor to be rotations per second, so you will need to convert It should tell the motor to go to that velocity CTRE example: Note: we use the Units Library here The core functionality is now done. In theory, we should be able to turn the intake  </p>"},{"location":"4/4.0/","title":"4 Advantage Kit/Scope","text":"<p>Before we run the mechanism, it is important to be able to read where the robot thinks the mechanism is You could imagine that if you move the elevator an inch and the robot thinks it went 3 inches, it is probable that when you tell the elevator to go to 3 inches it will only go an inch Basically we need to log the state of our mechanisms One way we could read information from the robot is System.out.println() This is used occasionally in FRC for niche purposes However, you could imagine that constantly printing the current positions and velocities of different mechanisms over time to the constant would get extremely annoying We need a way to graph these relationships in an organized fasion There are a couple of solutions for this; the most popular of which is called \u2018Advantage Scope\u2019 Advantage Scope allows people to plot values like position and velocity on graphs so we can observe how they change over time in a neater format However, Advantage Scope is far cooler than a graphing software, there are all sorts of ways you can visualize the information coming from your robot For now, lets focus on graphing the position or velocity of our mechanism Before we can do this, we need a way to get the information from the robot to our computer The solution to this is called \u2018NetworkTables\u2019 You can almost think of network tables as a bulletin board that both your robot and your computer can post and read information from Each sticky note has a name and a value (just like a variable) In NetworkTables, these sticky notes are called \u2018data entries\u2019 or \u2018logged data\u2019 And in NetworkTables, these data entries are being updated many times a second Advantage Scope shows you all of the data entries on Network Tables and lets you visualize them Now the question is: how do we get the robot to post to Network Tables so we can read information on Advantage Scope?  </p>"},{"location":"4/4.1/","title":"4.1 Advantage Kit","text":"<p>WPILib has a class for NetworkTables which has all the functionality we need: https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/networktables/NetworkTable.html  However, the team that made Advantage Scope, Mechanical Advantage #6328, also created \u2018Advantage Kit\u2019 Advantage Kit is basically a library that can be added to FRC code to handle logging data to NetworkTables However, installing Advantage Kit is not as simple as adding another vendor dep There is a way to convert existing projects like ours into advantage kit projects: https://docs.advantagekit.org/getting-started/installation/existing-projects  You may go through this process if you\u2019d like However, there are a lot of steps involved and for us it will be simpler to download one of Advantage Kit\u2019s template projects and start from there Download a template project for your robot (based on your type of drivetrain): https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/releases  Here are docs explaining more about template projects: https://docs.advantagekit.org/category/template-projects  If you aren\u2019t sure which template to choose, use the vision template Now extract the folder to a new folder (called \u201cFRCSoftwareTrainingAK,\u201d or whatever you like) in the same base directory where your original project is stored Now make that folder into a personal git repository using GitHub CLI Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/  Create the repo: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create  The structure of subsystems looks a little different under the Advantage Kit format, but fundamentally it\u2019s the same: Send commands to the motors Read information from the motors Our new version of our subsystem will have 3 layers Top level Subsystem (ex: Elevator.Java) Extends SubsystemBase Abstract IO (ex: ElevatorIO.Java) IO implementation (ex: ElevatorIOReal.Java) Implements abstract IO Follow this format and make these classes for your subsystem (for Elevator.java, use WPILib\u2019s create subsystem functionality) The abstract IO is technically not a class, but an interface, so change that accordingly The top level class is what is called by other classes in the code This is how other parts of the code get information from the mechanism and send information to the mechanism The IO layer (the other two files) can be thought of as one layer This is because the IO implementation or \u2018real\u2019 class will implement and therefore become an implementation of the abstract IO layer The job of the real class is to deal with the motor itself The top level will send commands and receive information from the IO layer The reason it is set up this way is so that we can have different implementations of the IO For example, imagine you want to be able to swap out a TalonFX motor for a SparkMAX motor at competition (bad idea, but possible) You could have one IO implementation for TalonFX and one IO implementation for SparkMAX The most common way this structure is used is for simulation You could have an \u2018ElevatorIOSim.java\u2019 class as well, which can interact with the simulation The takeaway is that the IO implementation will take methods like \u2018setHeight\u2019 that are in the abstract IO and give the functionality for setting   the height of the mechanism The top level class will have logic that doesn\u2019t change based on the IO implementation For example, Elevator.java might have a \u2018setScoringHeight\u2019 method that calls the \u2018setHeight\u2019 method of the IO class with a particular height Additionally, the IO will give information about the motor to the top level class This information can also be automatically logged by Advantage Kit Official information on IO: https://docs.advantagekit.org/data-flow/recording-inputs/io-interfaces  Now it\u2019s time to convert our old subsystem into the new format Copy the methods and instance fields from your old subsystem to the \u2018Real\u2019 class (except periodic) Rename the constructor Add those methods as abstract methods to the abstract IO class (except the constructor) This will mean removing the logic from the methods as well Now add the @Override keyword before each method in the real class (except constructor) Now add those same methods (except the constructor) to the top-level class Remove all logic from the inside of those methods (Java will get mad, that is okay) Add a constructor to the top level Add an instance field that is the abstract IO class and set it in the constructor with a parameter Now replace method logic with \u2018io.[methodName]\u2019 or \u2018return io.[methodName]\u2019 Now calling something from the top level will send commands to the bottom level (the IO) Now we need to find a way to log information to NetworkTables so we can view it in Advantage Scope Firstly, lets add a class to the abstract IO which stores the values we want to log Create a subclass called \u2018[SubsystemName]Inputs\u2019 in the abstract IO Add variables for the information you want to log This usually includes Device connected? Position Velocity  Voltage Current Temperature However, you can tailor it to the mechanism you have Elevator ex: Advantage Kit makes it very easy to log this information Add the keyword @AutoLog before the subclass Elevator ex: Now we need to update the values of the subclass We can do this from the io implementation Create a new method called \u201cupdateInputs\u201d in the io implementation which has the subclass as a parameter Add an abstract version of that method to the abstract class Override that abstract method in the io implementation Now update the variables of the inputs subclass in that method using motor methods CTRE Elevator ex: You will need to use StatusSignals if you use CTRE. They are similar to suppliers: https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/api-usage/status-signals.html  Now you can add a [SubsystemName]Inputs object as an instance field to the top level Then in periodic you can call the UpdateInputs method of the io object using the new inputs object Lastly, lets add methods to get information about our mechanism for other classes in our robot program Add getter methods for position or velocity depending on your mechanism (retrieve this information from the inputs object) Congratulations, your subsystem has been converted into the Advantage Kit format!  </p>"},{"location":"4/4.2/","title":"Advantage Scope Installation","text":"<p>Now install Advantage Scope in preparation for reading logged values https://docs.advantagescope.org/overview/installation/   </p>"},{"location":"4/4.3/","title":"4.3 Units","text":"<p>Create a new Constants class for the Drivetrain Add a constant for max speed Print that constant in App.javaStory time! In 1998, Nasa launched a new robotic space probe called \u201cThe Mars Climate Orbiter\u201d It cost $125 million (about the same as a modern FRC robot) It was designed to study the Martian atmosphere, the Martian surface, and relay communications Unfortunately, JPL lost control over the robot It disintegrated in the atmosphere :( Why did this happen? Some software provided to NASA by Lockheed martin used US units Other software that used that data created by NASA used imperial units The mismatch in units resulted in disaster This is a mistake that can be made on FRC robots as well So far, we\u2019ve been using inches, radians, radians/second, rotations/minute, ect. One thing we could do is try to stick to one base type of units only (like meters and radians) However, there would be a couple of drawbacks to this We would still need to perform unit conversions when sending information to motors (they only accept values in one type of unit) Using meters might make sense for the distance the robot traveled, but inches would make more sense for the distance the elevator traveled WPILib have created a solution! It is called the Units library: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/java-units.html  The idea is that you can store different physical quantities in objects For example, you can store \u20183 inches\u2019 in a Distance object When you want to get that information back out of the distance object, you will need to specify what units you want it in This way, there aren\u2019t just numbers floating around, there are objects that represent distances, velocities, times, voltages, ect. Here is an example of using the Distance class from the Units library: Notice how the number 3 was encoded with inches, then we converted that Distance object into meters Similar classes exists such as Angle, AngularVelocity, LinearVelocity, and many more You can even create your own units: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/java-units.html  Use the Units class wherever you have a value that represents a physical quantity in your subsystem Note that you will probably want to keep the values in the Inputs class as doubles because that way they will be logged in the units of your preference, rather than logged as objects  </p>"},{"location":"4/4.4/","title":"4.4 Tunable Numbers","text":"<p>Remember how we are going to use a PID (or an SVAP for velocity mechanisms) When we start testing our code on the physical robot, we\u2019ll want to tweak these values a lot to create a smooth motion  The problem is that it isn\u2019t as simple as tweaking the number in code and observing the results on the robot Every time we write new code on our computers, we need to redeploy that code to the robot, this will cause the robot software to restart, which can take a while This would make tweaking those values a nightmare CTRE has a very elegant solution to this In Pheonix Tuner X, you can adjust these values on the fly However To my knowledge, it is not this easy for REV There will certainly be other values in the code that you want to tweak quickly outside of motor configs Thankfully, Team #6328 has our backs again They\u2019ve created a class called LoggedTunableNumber in their robot code libraries: https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2025Public/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2025/util/LoggedTunableNumber.java  There are a couple places you can import this file in your code My team creates a folder in the frc directory called lib Inside that folder we create another folder called team[team number] Inside that folder, we import the files Import the LoggedTunableNumber class You will need to change the package declaration You can choose to create constants to replace the constants that existed in their project or to remove the use of those constants in the LoggedTunableNumber class Now create instance fields for your subsystem that represent the tunable numbers for the P, I, and D (or VSAP if you have an angular vel mech) Currently we simply set the PID when we construct the subsystem We need a way to update the PID whenever we change the tunable numbers For this, create a method that sets the config values of the PID/SVAP in the io (making sure to add an abstract version in the abstract io) CTRE ex: Now in the periodic method of the top-level you can use this logic to check if the tunable numbers have changed and update them accordingly: Now that you have a setConstants method, you can add that to the constructor, so it runs at the start of the program You can also remove the PID configs from the constructor in the IOReal class  </p>"},{"location":"4/4.5/","title":"4.5 Sensors","text":"<p>Your subsystem may or may not have a sensor If it does, you can read from that sensor and log the value, just like how you read information from the motor and log it Find the documentation for your specific sensor and find out how to read information from it Add a field to your Inputs subclass for that information Update that field in the UpdateInputs method You can also add a getter to your top level for this information Congratulations!

The power we need is proportional to cos(\u0472) CTRE will do these calculations automatically for the g constant. To my knowledge, for REV you will need pass in a tunable amount as a feedforward: https://docs.revrobotics.com/revlib/spark/closed-loop/getting-started-with-pid-tuning  If using REV and an arm, you will need to take cos(\u0472) into account manually Now try setting g to incrementally bigger values (after setting all other constants to 0) while being in the position control mode The goal is for the mechanism to start moving very very slowly; once you reach this, go back to the last value where it didn\u2019t NOTE: You may have the WRONG invert on your motor, if the motor is trying to spin the wrong direction, stop the motor, flip your invert before something breaks. If you are using an arm, make sure the arm is able to hold its position at all angles Now up the P constant to a small value Keep upping it until the mechanism goes to the target position you set in code Note: if using CTRE you may need to have non-zero values for max velocity and target acceleration before it will move Once it does, set the voltage to 0, let the mechanism go limp, and turn position control back on Take a look at advantage scope and observe how the position approaches the target position If you are using an arm, make sure the arm is able to hold its position at all angles Now up the P constant to a small value Keep upping it until the mechanism goes to the target position you set in code Once it does, set the voltage to 0, let the mechanism go limp, and turn position control back on Take a look at advantage scope and observe how the position approaches the target position It should look like one of the lines on the graph (the blue one is the target position If your graph looks like the red one, keep increasing the P constant and repeating the trial until you overshoot, then go back to the last non-overshooting P value If your graph looks like the green one or the purple one, your P is too high; lower it until it doesn\u2019t overshoot You can also try tuning the I and D constants for even smoother motion: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-pid.html#introduction-to-pid  If using CTRE motion magic, you should also tune max velocity and target acceleration In general, the voltage you put into your velocity motor is proportional the velocity it will go at This is why the V constant will be the most important constant to tune Increase your V value until your mechanism reaches your target velocity (eventually) after putting it into velocity control mode Note: if using CTRE Motion Magic, your target acceleration needs to be non-zero You can check this by looking at the velocity in Advantage Scope We can make this snappier Your velocity should follow a path similar to the red line on the right The blue line is the target velocity Start increasing the P constant until you overshoot velocity a little bit like the green line, then go back to the last non-overshooting value If using CTRE Motion magic, try adjusting your acceleration as well You can also play around with the S and A constants:  Now your mechanism should get to its target velocity in a reasonable time For an intake, this time needs to be very short For a shooter, depending on how it\u2019s used, it can take longer to spool up to full speed If applicable, try putting a game piece through your mechanism (safely and with a mentor/adult) See if the velocity drops noticeably as it goes through If the velocity drops quite a bit, especially for an intake/shooter, this is not ideal This either means, the mechanism needs to be tuned more or there is physically not enough power or Moment of Inertia to maintain target velocity.  It can also mean a bad physical gear ratio. This is absolutely something to talk to mechanics about.  </p>"},{"location":"5/5.5/","title":"5.5 Next Steps","text":"<p>Once you have your mechanism smoothly reaching its target position and velocity, try a couple other positions and velocities, make sure those work as expected as well Congratulations, you have written subsystem code, command code, binded a function to an Xbox controller button, and tuned/tested the subsystem I would HIGHLY suggest going through this whole process for the other two types of mechanisms as well if you have them on your robot.

A single top of the line FRC swerve module from the best company for swerve (SDS) will run your team back $395 (2025 numbers) You need 4 of those and 8 motors That is a lot of money Having a good finance subteam is very important Consider reaching out to SDS for a sponsorship There are also other quality models of swerve on the market such as MK4, MAXswerve, and Swerve X which are somewhat cheaper Swerve has established itself as the dominant drive train in FRC in recent years If your team does not currently use swerve, it is a great direction to move in for competitiveness Before diving into the specifics of each type of drivetrain, it is also helpful to learn about different ways to control robot movement There are two main ways: Robot-centric  Field-centric Robot-Centric means that \u201cforward\u201d on the stick means move whichever way the robot is facing This can become confusing quickly as the robot rotates a lot on the field and the driver needs to keep track of which way is \u201cforward\u201d The better and more modern way to drive is called \u201cfield-centric\u201d Field centric means that pressing forward on the stick will drive the robot away from the driver on the field (toward the opposing field wall) This won\u2019t change even if the robot rotates This relies on the robot knowing which way it is facing so it can correct for its own rotation when the driver wants it to move in a particular direction This means that field-centric robots need an IMU (basically a gyro) to keep track of their rotation Note that IMUs are relative. They actually track angular acceleration rather than angular position but are able to convert acceleration to position. This means that similar to needing to tell an elevator when its at zero position and zeroing it, you will need to tell the robot what orientation it is in at the start of a match. Ideally, you will also have a button to re-zero the robot orientation if needed WPILib has also introduced a standard way to tell a drivetrain subsystem how to act This is called a ChassisSpeeds object The ChassisSpeeds object stores 3 values X velocity (left right) Y velocity (forward backward) Omega (angular vel) This information can be sent to the drivetrain as a command and received from the drivetrain as logged data Identify what drivetrain your robot has (if you have a robot) Go to the corresponding section for your drivetrain 6.A: Swerve 6.B: Mecanum 6.C: Differential (Tank)  </p>"},{"location":"6/6.1/","title":"6.1 Swerve","text":"<p>If your project is based off the Advantage Kit swerve template, you are in a good place If not, download the swerve template and move your subsystem code, commands, and button bindings into a swerve template Make sure to download the correct template for your motor types I could explain how to get your drivetrain up and running in this slideshow, but I would be directly repeating what 6328 has already documented Follow the setup instructions for your swerve template project: https://docs.advantagekit.org/category/template-projects  Once you have it set up, try running your drivetrain and moving your robot (with proper safety precautions) If it\u2019s not working, you can check logged values on advantage scope to help debug the issue.

In this case, it can be helpful to think of each module as its own subsystem with its own logged values and methods Remember a mecanum module is an angular velocity mechanism, but it can also provide linear velocity information based on how fast the circumference of the wheel is moving (radius * omega radians) Then, a Drive subsystem can be created with an array of four mecanum subsystem objects inside of it. The Drive subsystem will convert ChassisSpeeds into individual module outputs using WPILib\u2019s MecanumDriveKinematics. Using WPILib\u2019s mecanum libraries, your drive subsystem should be able to convert a ChassisSpeeds object into method calls to individual module subsystems For further reference on how to code a mecanum drivetrain, check out the swerve templates for advantage kit. Both mecanum and swerve work with individual modules and ChassisSpeeds objects. For driving field-centric, you will need a gyro (IMU) subsystem as well. You will need a command that takes Suppliers from the xbox sticks and converts them to method calls to the drive subsystem (generally, left stick is movement, right is rotation).
