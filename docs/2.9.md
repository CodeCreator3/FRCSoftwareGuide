# 2.9 Rebases
When we merged our branches into main, GitHub knew how to combine each branch so that everyone’s files were added  
This is called an automatic merge  
Automatic merges are not always possible   
For example, what if two people made unrelated changes to the same file  
We can merge manually  
One person create a file called “Robot.Java” in the master branch  
Create instance field height and a constructor  
Commit that directly to the master branch (usually don’t do this in FRC because all code should be reviewed)  
If you are with other programmers  
find a partner (or group of three)  
create a new branch off main for your whole group (combine initials for the name)  
Now have two members create new branches off that (using first initial, last name for branch names)  
You can create a branch off of a specific branch using “Create Branch From” in command pallete  
If you are alone, create two branches off master, one called “a” another called “b”  
Now on one of the new branches, add instance field ‘weight’ (make sure to add that as a parameter for the constructor)  
On the other branch, create instance field ‘name’  
Merge the ‘weight’ branch into the branch it came from using a pull request   
Do not merge into master if you are in a group  
Now, try doing the same process with the ‘name’ branch  
You should be unable to automatically merge  
Go back into VSCode, open command pallete, hit “rebase branch”  
Make sure to rebase it using the branch it came from  
A Rebase is essentially a manual merge but fancier  
Rebases are like taking the things that happened on the central branch while you’ve been busy working on the new development branch and putting them behind the changes on the development branch  
- It’s like if on timeline A you played Minecraft and on timeline B you ate a hamburger, merging them with a rebase would mean you played Minecraft, then ate a hamburger  
When you rebase, try to include both changes where possible so that in the end, both instance fields are there, they both are passed through the constructor, and they both have all their getters and setters  
This is a simple rebase  
With larger code bases, they get much more complicated  
It takes practice  
Once the rebase has completed, commit the changes from it  
Now you can automatically merge
