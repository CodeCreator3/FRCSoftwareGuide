# 3.1 Robot Projects
Like before, we need to create a Java project for our robot
However, this time we need it to take advantage of all the stuff WPILib has given us
Ability to talk to the roborio
Libraries to communicate with xbox controllers
Configuration
Extra important stuff
Instead of creating a basic Java project, we will create a Robot project

Make a new repo on your personal GitHub called FRCSoftwareTraining
Clone the repo
Open command pallete
Hit “WPILib: Create a new project”
Fill the info like on the right (make sure to make the base folder your repo and the project name is exactly the same as the folder of your repo)

You should end up with something like this
Commit everything with a message like ‘init’
Congrats, you now have a robot codebase!
