# 3.5 Motor Object
Similar to how we have Java classes/objects for Subsystems, we need a class for motors
Lucky for us, this coding has already been done by companies like REV Robotics and CTRE
Figure out which company made your motor/motor controller (if its not on the chart, look it up):
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/can-devices/third-party-devices.html 
If your team is deciding between motor options for your next season
I would always say shoot for Kraken X60s or Kraken X44s even at a higher price point
The CTRE ecosystem is very user friendly
Advanced motion control software
These motors have incredible performance. All of the top teams use them because of this.
Neo 550s may be $30, but the motor controller you need to control them is $100 (2025 numbers)
If its CTRE, you likely use a TalonFX motor object: https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/java/com/ctre/phoenix6/hardware/TalonFX.html 
If its REV, you likely use a Spark MAX motor object: https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/spark/sparkmax 
It could also be a Talon SRX, Victor SPX, or SPARK Flex
You will need to use the API Documentation corresponding to your motor for the following slides
Before we can create a motor object, we need to install the vendor libraries for that motor
To do this, go to the vendor dependencies tab on the left sidebar in VSCode
Install CTRE Pheonix-6 or REVLib
Before creating a motor object, we need the device ID or CAN ID (if you don’t have a robot, make it up!)
To find the CAN ID, you will need to open the software for your vendor
For CTRE it is called Pheonix Tuner X (very nice software)
For REV it is called the REV Hardware Client
Download this software, open it, and power on your robot
For CTRE you can just connect to your robot’s network
For REV you will need to connect to your PDH or motor controller via USB
In the software you should see a list of motors/motor controllers/sensors
If they aren’t named, you can usually ‘blink’ motors by pressing a ‘blink’ button
This will make the LED on the motor blink so you can tell which motor is which
You will also be able to view and modify CAN IDs here
Make sure each motor has a unique CAN ID
Note down the CAN ID(s) for the motor(s) for your specific mechanism
Go back to your code and open Constants.Java
Create a subclass called “CanIDs”
Create a constant for your CAN ID
Now create an instance field in your subsystem for you motor object
The parameter of the motor constructor should be the constant of the CAN ID
Keep in mind, some motors are not connected to the default Can Bus
Some are on a separate CAN loop such as a CANivore
If you are unsure about this, ask someone who worked on the electronics on your team
If the motor is not on the main CAN bus, you will need to specify the CAN bus name in the motor constructor as well (the name can be found in the vendor software)
In the subsystem constructor, you will have to configure the motor
The best practice on this vary by vendor (see documentation)
Typically, you want to configure:
Motor invert (if you don’t know, you can find out later by running the motor carefully)
Current limit (this will come back to bite you later if you don’t set it. Generally aim for 30 amps. CTRE docs on this.)
Neutral mode should be set to brake (when not in brake mode, mechanisms will go limp)
Configuring PID constants will be discussed later
CTRE example:
Note that kG is the feed forward that resists gravity
If you are using MotionMagic, you will also need to tune acceleration and cruise velocity later
Some mechanisms have two (or more; looking at you 2910) motors powering the same element (this allows for snappier motion)
If this is the case:
define another motor
Call the first one “lead”
Call the second one “follower”
In the constructor, configure the follower to be a follower to the lead (vendors make it easy to do this, it’s usually a simple configuration)
Sometimes the motors need to rotate in opposite directions to power the same mechanism
In this case, make sure to set them as inverted in the configuration
It’s good practice to have a setVoltage method in every subsystem
This way, you can set the voltage to 0 when necessary
Create the setVoltage method with a ‘volts’ parameter and find your motor object’s setVoltage method and call it in your setVoltage method
