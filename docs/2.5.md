# 2.5 Cloning
The next step is to download a local copy of the repo  
It is possible to download a zip file with the repo files inside of it, but this won’t link back to the cloud repo  
Instead, we do what’s called “cloning”  
Follow the images  
Go into VSCode  
Press ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p  
This will open the “command pallet”  
Type “clone”  
Click “Git: Clone” (this will only work if Git is installed and you’ve restarted VSCode)  
Paste the link and hit enter  
Choose where to store it (most people create a GitHub folder in Documents and store GitHub projects in there)
