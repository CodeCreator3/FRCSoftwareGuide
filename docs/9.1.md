# Title
If your project is based off the Advantage Kit swerve template, you are in a good place
If not, download the swerve template and move your subsystem code, commands, and button bindings into a swerve template
Make sure to download the correct template for your motor types

I could explain how to get your drivetrain up and running in this slideshow, but I would be directly repeating what 6328 has already documented
Follow the setup instructions for your swerve template project:
https://docs.advantagekit.org/category/template-projects 
Once you have it set up, try running your drivetrain and moving your robot (with proper safety precautions)
If it’s not working, you can check logged values on advantage scope to help debug the issue. You should also make sure all of your swerve motors are up to date and CAN IDed correctly.

I would highly encourage looking through the template swerve code to find out how it works
Note that with swerve, there is a high-level drive subsystem as well as lower-level swerve module subsystems
Look for things like
Where are methods for turning motors
How is a field-oriented x-y-omega (ChassisSpeeds) object converted into individual motor commands
Many high-level teams make their own additions and modifications to their drive subsystem to meet their needs
As you gain experience as a programmer, you may have changes in mind as well
