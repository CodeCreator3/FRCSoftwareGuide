# 1.8: Scanner
Scanner is a way for us to type text into the console, which will put that text into our program.
We don’t use Scanner in FRC because it would be silly to be typing information into our computers during a match rather than using a controller
It is a useful tool for learning Java
Here is an example:




I typed “Hi!” into the console, the program said what I typed.
Again, we need to import Scanner so Java knows we want those libraries
The scanner is its own variable type
You can create a scanner object by running “new Scanner(System.in)”
Once you create the scanner, you can use scanner.nextLine to get a String from what the user put into the console
It’s good practice to write scanner.close at the end of the program to prevent a memory leak
- Practice: 
Create an integer and assign it to some value
Allow the user to guess a number
If it’s too large, print “Too Large” and allow them to guess again
If it’s too small, print “Too Small” and allow them to guess again
If it is correct, print “You win, that took x tries”
If you want to go above and beyond, use java.util.Random and random.nextInt to generate random game numbers
