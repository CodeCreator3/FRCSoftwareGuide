# 1.5: Logic
Logic statements allows us to create more complex code  
Some logic statements  
if  
else  
for  
While  
These will be explained in this chapter  
## 1.5.1: if
if while run code on a condition. If the condition isn’t met, the code is skipped. Run this:  
Then this (flip the less than sign to greater than):  
- Practice: make it only print if x divided by y is greater than 1 and less than 10  
You can add else after the ‘}’ of the if statement to run something if the condition is false  
## 1.5.2: else
Practice:  
make x and y Booleans  
Print “yay” if they are equal  
Print “nay” if they are not equal (using else)  
‘for’ is how we repeat code  
Example:  
Functionality  
Step 1: Java will assign ‘i’ to zero (assignment)  
Step 2: Java will check whether i is less than 10 (comparison)  
True: continue  
False: exit  
Step 3: java will add 1 to I (increment)  
That code prints 0 through 9 because when i = 10, it fails the condition i < 10  
Now change the code to print [0, 2, 4, … , 18]  
Practice  
Now write another integer y before the if statement  
Set it to 4  
Make the condition if y times i is not equal to y times 5  
Make the increment i++  
Try to understand what the result means  
while is like a simpler version of for.  
Loops through values. Every time it checks a condition. If the condition is false, the loop exits.  
Ex:  
Practice: make it print 0 to -7
