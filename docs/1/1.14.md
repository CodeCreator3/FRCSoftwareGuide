# 1.14: Suppliers
There’s one more Java concept that is pretty integral in FRC code  
Let’s set up a project  
Create one more Java project  
Create a class called Clock.Java that has an integer instance field ‘ticks’  
Create a ‘tick’ method that increments ‘ticks’ by one  
Create a ‘getTime’ method that returns ticks  
In App.java, create Clock object  
Create a new int called “currentTime” and set it to the output of the getTime method  
Start a while loop. Make the condition of the loop ‘true’ (so it infinitely repeats).  
You will be able to stop the program by pressing the red square  
In the while loop, tick the clock then print the current time variable  
Observe the result  
As you may have expected, we get this:  
Determine why this is happening  
The problem is that we set the variable currentTime once before the while loop and then never updated it again  
This means it only printed the first value we assigned to it  
One solution is to do update the ‘currentValue’ variable every time in the while loop  
Suppliers allow us to skip this step  
Modify the code to this:  
Observe results  
If an integer stores a number, an integer supplier stores the directions to get that number  
It’s like taking a picture of the empire state building and showing it to someone vs giving that person directions to see it for themselves   whenever they want  
When Java ran into our currentTime.get() call, it actually went and reran clock.getTime() to find the latest value  
There are a couple key syntax updates to keep in mind  
We use Supplier<[Return Type]> to create the specific type of Supplier  
Note that I used Integer rather than int because Java expects an object, not a primitive in the “<>”  
The double colon tells java that we want a supplier of a method rather than the output of the method  
When we want to run the code that the supplier is pointing to, we call ‘.get()’  
Suppliers can handle parameters as well, but when defining the supplier use the “() ->” format  
Here is an FRC example:  
You want a section of code to run when you press a button  
In that way you want the code to be run every time you press the button, not just once at the start of the program  
Suppliers are helpful for this
