# Enums
Our Files are getting a little ugly  
We can organize them by creating folders in the src folder  
Drag Pet, Dog, and Cat in a pets folder  
Drag Building, House, and School in a buildings folder  
Accept the changes from Java Red Hat  
Red Hat added the package keyword with the name of the folder at the top of the files we moved  
Red Hat also added imports to App.java  
This tells Java where to access these classes now that they aren’t in the base directory
