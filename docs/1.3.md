Press “Run” above the main method
Observe output in terminal
Congrats, you ran your first Java program
Practice: Make it print “Hello, FRC World”

Ignore the “public class App” and “public static void main…” for now.
What’s important is that the code inside the purple brackets is run when we press “run”
