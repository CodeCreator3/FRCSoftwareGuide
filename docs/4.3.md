# 4.3 Units
Create a new Constants class for the Drivetrain
Add a constant for max speed
Print that constant in App.java






Story time!
In 1998, Nasa launched a new robotic space probe called “The Mars Climate Orbiter”
It cost $125 million (about the same as a modern FRC robot)
It was designed to study the Martian atmosphere, the Martian surface, and relay communications
Unfortunately, JPL lost control over the robot
It disintegrated in the atmosphere :(
Why did this happen?
Some software provided to NASA by Lockheed martin used US units
Other software that used that data created by NASA used imperial units
The mismatch in units resulted in disaster
This is a mistake that can be made on FRC robots as well
So far, we’ve been using inches, radians, radians/second, rotations/minute, ect.
One thing we could do is try to stick to one base type of units only (like meters and radians)
However, there would be a couple of drawbacks to this
We would still need to perform unit conversions when sending information to motors (they only accept values in one type of unit)
Using meters might make sense for the distance the robot traveled, but inches would make more sense for the distance the elevator traveled
WPILib have created a solution!
It is called the Units library: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/java-units.html 
The idea is that you can store different physical quantities in objects
For example, you can store ‘3 inches’ in a Distance object
When you want to get that information back out of the distance object, you will need to specify what units you want it in
This way, there aren’t just numbers floating around, there are objects that represent distances, velocities, times, voltages, ect.
Here is an example of using the Distance class from the Units library:

Notice how the number 3 was encoded with inches, then we converted that Distance object into meters
Similar classes exists such as Angle, AngularVelocity, LinearVelocity, and many more
You can even create your own units: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/java-units.html 

Use the Units class wherever you have a value that represents a physical quantity in your subsystem
Note that you will probably want to keep the values in the Inputs class as doubles because that way they will be logged in the units of your preference, rather than logged as objects
