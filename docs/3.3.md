# 3.3 Subsystem Structure
You will notice there is some pre-generated code  
There is a constructor and a ‘periodic’ method  
This class is extending ‘SubsystemBase’  
There are some cool technical details behind how this works, but what is important is that ‘periodic’ will be called 50 times per second by a background process.  
This allows us to put repeating code in the periodic method and one-time code in the contructor
