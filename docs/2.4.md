# 2.4 Repository
Repositories are basically codebases/projects  
Each robot will have its own repository with code specific to that robot  
Have your organization create a training repository  
If you are working by yourself, you can also just create a repo on your GitHub account  
Make it public and empty and name it something like “SoftwareTraining”
