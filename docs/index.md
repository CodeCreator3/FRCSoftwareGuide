# FRC Software Guide
## Overview
- This course is designed to take anyone from zero to high-level FRC programmer
- This course is based in Java
- Software has the most aggressive learning curve of any area of FRC
- As with any course, learning must be supplemented with practice
- The value you get out of this is directly proportional to the effort you put in
- The course is setup to be ready linearly from start to finish, but readers with experience are welcome to jump around
- The goal is to teach Java, then basic FRC software, then advanced FRC software
- This guide is up to date November 2025. 
- Software changes fast, so always refer to updated online documentation when unsure.
- Please enjoy! ❤️

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with FIRST Robotics and FIRST Robotics Competition (how the program works)
- A functional laptop/PC
- Some time
- A drive to learn
- Optional: A robot with a mechanism to test with
