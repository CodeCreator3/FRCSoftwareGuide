# 5.3 Elastic
If you don’t, we just need to create a button that we can press from our laptops  
WPILib’s solution for this is called “Shuffleboard”  
Team 353 made a better version of Shuffleboard called “Elastic”

Elastic is geared towards being a dashboard for behind the glass (at the driver station)  
However, it is also a useful programmer’s tool  
Let’s create a button we can press in elastic that will zero the robot  
To create a button, this is the format:  
‘SmartDashboard.putData’ takes in two parameters  
The name of the button  
A command to run when the button is pressed  
Notice how I didn’t create a new command class for zeroing the elevator  
Commands.runOnce will take in a supplier to be ran when the command is initialized  
In this case, I created a method in the elevator class that sets the sensor position to a ‘home position’ (for you this will probably be zero, it should be the place that the mechanism usually rests in. You will need to put the mechanism in this position before pressing the zero button).  
Create your zero button  
Create a brake mode and coast mode button
