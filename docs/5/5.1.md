# 5.1 Creating Commands
To make a command, right click on the ‘commands’ folder and click “create a new class or command”, then choose command  
Name it based on your mechanism (setElevatorHeight, setShooterVelocity, setArmAngle)  
Now pass in your subsystem as a parameter and create an instance field for your subsystem  
Call the ‘addRequirements’ method in your constructor and pass in your subsystem  
This tells the robot code to reserve control of that subsystem to that command, so you don’t get multiple commands controlling the same subsystem at the same time  
You will notice a few pre-generated methods  
These relate to the choreography and timing of how your command runs  
They will be called by the command scheduler behind the scenes  
Read the comments to understand how each method is called  
For our purposes, using the ‘initialize’ and ‘end’ methods will suffice  
We want to start the mechanism when the command is initialized (button pressed) and end it when the command ends (button lifted)  
In ‘initialize’ call your subsystem’s set-position or set-velocity method (create a constructor parameter and instance field for the position/velocity)  
In ‘end’ call your subsystem’s ‘setVoltage’ method and set the voltage to zero
