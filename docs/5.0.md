# 5 Commands
Before we can start testing our code on the robot, we need a way to tell the subsystem what to do based on inputs from an Xbox controller
This is called a “Command”
Commands have subsystems as instance fields and call methods of the subsystems during their runtimes
You could imagine that a complex action like scoring a gamepiece could take complex choreography between the drivetrain, indexer, shooter, and vision system
Commands store this choreography
