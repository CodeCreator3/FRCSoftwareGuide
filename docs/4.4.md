# 4.4 Tunable Numbers
Remember how we are going to use a PID (or an SVAP for velocity mechanisms)
When we start testing our code on the physical robot, we’ll want to tweak these values a lot to create a smooth motion 
The problem is that it isn’t as simple as tweaking the number in code and observing the results on the robot
Every time we write new code on our computers, we need to redeploy that code to the robot, this will cause the robot software to restart, which can take a while
This would make tweaking those values a nightmare
CTRE has a very elegant solution to this
In Pheonix Tuner X, you can adjust these values on the fly
However
To my knowledge, it is not this easy for REV
There will certainly be other values in the code that you want to tweak quickly outside of motor configs
Thankfully, Team #6328 has our backs again
They’ve created a class called LoggedTunableNumber in their robot code libraries: https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2025Public/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2025/util/LoggedTunableNumber.java 
There are a couple places you can import this file in your code
My team creates a folder in the frc directory called lib
Inside that folder we create another folder called team[team number]
Inside that folder, we import the files
Import the LoggedTunableNumber class
You will need to change the package declaration
You can choose to create constants to replace the constants that existed in their project or to remove the use of those constants in the LoggedTunableNumber class
Now create instance fields for your subsystem that represent the tunable numbers for the P, I, and D (or VSAP if you have an angular vel mech)
Currently we simply set the PID when we construct the subsystem
We need a way to update the PID whenever we change the tunable numbers
For this, create a method that sets the config values of the PID/SVAP in the io (making sure to add an abstract version in the abstract io)



CTRE ex:


Now in the periodic method of the top-level you can use this logic to check if the tunable numbers have changed and update them accordingly:




Now that you have a setConstants method, you can add that to the constructor, so it runs at the start of the program


You can also remove the PID configs from the constructor in the IOReal class
