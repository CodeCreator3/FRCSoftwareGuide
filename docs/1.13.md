# 1.13: Project
You have learned quite a few concepts
You have put those individual concepts to work with practice problems
Now you need to put it all together in a personal project
You will likely want to create a new Java project for this so you don’t have to deal with all the files we’ve already created
You can choose between 
1.13.A: Wordle
1.13.B: The Price is Right
Make your own project
Or do both if you want extra practice
Never played? Give it a try: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html 
Create a list of words
Randomly choose from that list each game
Have player enter a guess
Tell players which letters are 
incorrect
correct but in wrong place
correct in right place
Notify player if the player won
Keep track of moves
List of items (Do FRC components (roborio, battery), its more fun)
Randomly choose an item
Player inputs number of players and names
Player guesses
Next player guesses (ect. Until all players have guessed)
Player with closes amount who doesn’t go over gets the money added to their account
If they guess exactly, it’s plus $500
Print current scores each round
After x rounds, the player with the most money wins
