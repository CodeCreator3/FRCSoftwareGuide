# 3.2 Subsystem Class
Enter the src folder
Then open java/frc/robot
There is a lot going on here, but there is a folder for subsystems
At this point, if you have a robot with a mechanism, choose the simplest subsystem on that robot (not the drivetrain, not a turret)
Elevators and shooters are ideal
If you don’t have a robot/mechanism, find a robot online and pretend you are coding its mechanism
Whatever subsystem you chose probably falls into one of three categories
Identify the category your subsystem fits into (even if it isn’t on the list)
Some subsystems are purely voltage control (like grabbers in pick and place games)
These are far simpler than other types of mechanisms, I would advise choosing a different subsystem
Sometimes subsystems combine categories
Ex: 2930’s 2024 Shooter
Combines 
angular position control (pivot)
Angular velocity control (flywheels)
Ex: 2910’s 2023 and 2025 Arm
Combines 
angular position control (pivot)
Linear position control (extender)
Angular position control (wrist)
For now we’ll try to avoid subsystems that combine multiple degrees of freedom (ways it can move)
If needed, you can focus on one degree of freedom of a subsystem that has multiple
During build season, focus on coding the most important subsystems first (drivetrain, intake, scoring mech)
Right now, focus on coding the simplest subsystems first
The first step is to right click on the subsystems folder and hit “Create a New Class or Command,” then hit subsystem
Give your subsystem an adequate name for the engineering term that describes that mechanism (don’t put “Subsystem” after the main word)
