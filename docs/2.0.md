# 2 GitHub
The Java files you have been working on are stored in your computer
Now imagine those Java files are your robot code
Also consider that you have teammates who want to contribute as well
How do you allow everyone to work on the code?
One option could be to have everyone work on your computer
This would be a huge bottleneck because only one person would be able to work at a time
Also you would need to give your computer to others for them to work on the code
Another option could be to email all the files to all your teammates and have them work on their own systems
Now you have multiple different versions of the code
Which code do you actually use?
The solution is GitHub
GitHub is cloud storage for coding projects
You can upload your project to the cloud and teammates can download their own copies to develop with
Once your teammates have developed new code, they can upload those changes to the central cloud version
The truth is that it’s a little more complicated than that
Hence the addition of this chapter to the guide
