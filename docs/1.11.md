# 1.11: Enums
We know how to store numbers, words, and Booleans, as well as bigger things like Students, Cats, and Dogs  
What about states? Like what day of the week it is or what emotion someone is feeling?  
This is the role of Enums  
Add this to your Student class near the bottom (like after the setFavoriteClass function):  
Now add Emotion as an instance field just like favorite class and GPA  
Now set emotions for your students  
You will need to include the class Student before using ‘Emotion.EMOTION’ to get the emotion enums. This specifies where the Emotion enums are
Do the same process but for Clothes  
Clothing enum  
JEANS  
SWEATS  
SKIRT  
LEGGINGS  
SHIRT  
TANK_TOP  
There should be an instance field in student which has an array of clothes enums  
Before you modify App.Java with your changes, Java is a little weird… read next slide  
To properly create an array of clothing items, you need to import the Clothes enum  
To import that enum, you need to put Student.Java in a package  
Create a folder called ‘people’  
Put Student.Java in that folder/package  
Now when you create an array of enums, use this format  
The ‘new Clothes[]’ is important because it tells Java what type of Array to create  
The reason we didn’t need to do that before is because we were assigning this information to objects directly  
Because of this, we had to specify what type of array it would be in that very line. So Java knew what array it was supposed to create:  
Now we are passing it directly into the constructor, so Java needs the extra info  
What if we want to do various things based on the current state of the enum. Like say “How are you feeling” if someone’s sad, say “I’m sorry” if they’re angry, say “Good day” if they’re happy, ect.  
We could use if else statements:  
When you put an if statement after an else, it only checks that condition if the previous condition fails  
This is a little ugly  
We can use a switch case instead:  
This is easier to read and less typing  
The switch statement checks the output of getEmotion and compares it to the cases provided  
If getEmotion doesn’t match any of the provided cases, it will run the default case  
Make sure to put ‘break’ at the end of each case  
This keeps Java from running the logic of the next case  
Ex: if you didn’t have any breaks and the case was ANGRY, it would also run the logic of HAPPY, ANXIOUS, and the default case  
Practice:  
Create method that takes a Student object as input and outputs the materials of the student’s clothes using a switch case  
You may need multiple methods for this  
Materials:  
Jeans: Denim  
Sweats: Cotton  
Skirt: Linen  
Leggings: Spandex  
Shirt: Cotton  
Tank Top: Polyester  
Test your method on a student
