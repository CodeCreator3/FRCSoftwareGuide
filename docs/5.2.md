# 5.2 Running Commands
Now we need to bind this command to a button on the controller
This is where the ‘RobotContainer’ class comes in
Open that class/file
There should already be an xbox controller object instance field:

There is also a spot for subsystem instance fields:
Add your subsystem as an instance field

Now we need to instantiate the subsystem in the constructor
You will notice a switch case in the constructor for the robot type:

In the real case, simply construct your subsystem using the top level subsystem constructor and the IOReal constructor inside of that
There is also a sim case. Usually in this case, we would pass in an IOSim class; however, we have not written code for that yet, so we are going to pass in a “fake” implementation
To pass in a “fake” implementation, call the top level constructor and pass in ‘new [subsystem name]IO(){}’

This creates an implementation of the IO class with no logic. So nothing will happen when your code tries to use this implementation.
Do the same for the default case
You will notice that at the end of the RobotContainer constructor the ‘setButtonBindings’ method is called
This method tells the Xbox controller object what code to call when a button is pressed
At the end of that method you can add a binding for your command using this logic:



Make sure your binding doesn’t conflict with other bindings
If we have a mechanism that needs to be zeroed (angular position or linear position), then we need to create a button for that too
You could imagine this would not be a good button to have on the Xbox controller (wouldn’t want to accidentally zero the robot during a match)
Many high-level teams have a physical button on their robot for this
If you have this on your robot, create a digital input that zeroes the robot: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/hardware-apis/sensors/digital-inputs-software.html 
Having a zero button and a brake/coast mode toggle button physically on the robot was a lifesaver for my team. Your team should highly consider adding these to their next robot.
