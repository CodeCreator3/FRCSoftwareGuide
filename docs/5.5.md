# 5.5 Next Steps
Once you have your mechanism smoothly reaching its target position and velocity, try a couple other positions and velocities, make sure those work as expected as well
Congratulations, you have written subsystem code, command code, binded a function to an Xbox controller button, and tuned/tested the subsystem
I would HIGHLY suggest going through this whole process for the other two types of mechanisms as well if you have them on your robot. If you do this, you will learn the nuances of these other mechanisms and have subsystem code for complex subsystem choreography later.
Trust me, it will be a lot faster now that you’ve done it before
