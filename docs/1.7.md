# 1.7: Methods
Methods allow us to reuse logic without having to type it out again
Methods can have inputs and outputs
Lets make one!
Write this code:
‘operation’ takes two integers as input and outputs an integer. Here is the formatting:
Visibility: explained later. Stick to ‘public’ for now
Static: explained later. Stick to ‘static’ for now
Return type, the type of value you get out of the method
Name: name used to call (run) the method
Inputs: what you put into the method. The method can process the inputs to produce the output
Even the ‘main’ method is a method. It is called by Java when you press ‘run’
Nearly all code lives inside methods
Practice: 
Make a method that takes a string as input and outputs that string with a space after it
Make a method that combines 3 strings using that first method
Make a method that takes in 3 strings, prints the output of the 2nd method with those strings, then prints whether the length of the output of the 2nd method is greater than 10 (using String.length)
Hint: assign the output of the second method to a variable
Run the third method with 3 Strings of your choice in main
You can also have methods that don’t output anything. To do this, make the return type ‘void’.
- You can also have methods that don’t require an input:
