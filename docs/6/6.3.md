# Differential (Tank)
If your project is based off the Advantage Kit differential drive template, you are in a good place  
If not, download the differential drive template and move your subsystem code, commands, and button bindings into it  
I could explain how to get your drivetrain up and running in this slideshow, but I would be directly repeating what 6328 has already documented
Follow the setup instructions for your diffy drive template project:  
https://docs.advantagekit.org/category/template-projects   
Once you have it set up, try running your drivetrain and moving your robot (with proper safety precautions)  
If it’s not working, you can check logged values on advantage scope to help debug the issue. You should also make sure all of your swerve motors are up to date and CAN IDed correctly.
