# 2.8 Issues
During a season there are often many things happening or planned  
Write elevator code  
Fix that drivetrain bug  
Add a README  
Refactor autonomous code  
Issues allow us to store information of what is being worked on and what needs to change  
To Create an issue, go to the ‘Issues’ tab in GitHub  
Name the issue and give a description (can be anything)  
Issues don’t have to be literal issues/problems, they can be new things you want to add or modifications you want to make  
On the right, under ‘assignees’ press “assign yourself”  
This is very important when you are developing on a project with multiple people  
If you don’t assign yourself to an issue and start working on it, your friend might start working on that same issue and now we’re wasting time  
You can also link branches to issues so people know where the development is happening  
This option can be found in the bottom right  
You can also label issues as ‘bugs’, ‘enhancements’, and ‘good first issues’ on the right  
Give your issue a label  
You can even create new labels like ‘high-priority’ or ‘subsystem’ or ‘command’:   
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels   
If you are working in a group, find someone else’s issue  
Write a comment saying you completed it (pretend you completed it)  
Close the issue
