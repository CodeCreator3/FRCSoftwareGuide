# 4.5 Sensors
Your subsystem may or may not have a sensor  
If it does, you can read from that sensor and log the value, just like how you read information from the motor and log it  
Find the documentation for your specific sensor and find out how to read information from it  
Add a field to your Inputs subclass for that information  
Update that field in the UpdateInputs method  
You can also add a getter to your top level for this information  
Congratulations! Your subsystem code should now meet the standards of a lot of high-level teams.  
Note, there is likely a lot of code in your subsystem now; use comments to organize things and make things understandable to collaborators:
