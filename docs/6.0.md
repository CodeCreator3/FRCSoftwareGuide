# 6 Drivetrain
In almost every FRC game, a robot that doesn’t move doesn’t contribute to the alliance (often, a non-moving robot contributes negatively to the alliance)
Getting the software for the drivetrain correct is pivotal in team competitiveness
Even having one match where your robot doesn’t move can dramatically effect which teams will pick you in alliance selection
Additionally, when drivetrain design and code is done very well, it gives that team an exceptional advantage over other teams
There are 3 primary forms of drivetrains in modern FRC
The first is called tank drive
Tank drive is generally the cheapest
Two sides of wheels are independently 
driven
If both sides go forward, the robot goes
forward
If one goes forward and one goes backward, the robot turns
It is also known as ‘differential drive’
The second is called mecanum
With mecanum, there are four modules
Each module has it’s own motor and can be driven independently
Through a bunch of interesting science that isn’t super necessary to understand, this allows forward motion, backward motion, sideways motion, and rotating
The improvement from tank is that mecanum allows for side-to-side motion
Mecanum is also fairly cheap
The main issues with mecanum are that 
your robot can be pushed around easily
Your robot will not deal with bumps well
Your robot will have trouble accelerating and changing direction quickly (especially side-to-side)
Swerve involves four modules (like mecanum)
Each individual module has a wheel that can change it’s direction and angular velocity
In one module, one motor determines the direction of the wheel, one motor determines the angular velocity of the wheel
This allows for side-to-side motion, forward backward motion, and rotational motion
It also allows for incredible accelerations, stability, and bumps
The only downside is the price.
A single top of the line FRC swerve module from the best company for swerve (SDS) will run your team back $395 (2025 numbers)
You need 4 of those and 8 motors
That is a lot of money
Having a good finance subteam is very important
Consider reaching out to SDS for a sponsorship
There are also other quality models of swerve on the market such as MK4, MAXswerve, and Swerve X which are somewhat cheaper
Swerve has established itself as the dominant drive train in FRC in recent years
If your team does not currently use swerve, it is a great direction to move in for competitiveness
Before diving into the specifics of each type of drivetrain, it is also helpful to learn about different ways to control robot movement
There are two main ways:
Robot-centric 
Field-centric
Robot-Centric means that “forward” on the stick means move whichever way the robot is facing
This can become confusing quickly as the robot rotates a lot on the field and the driver needs to keep track of which way is “forward”
The better and more modern way to drive is called “field-centric”
Field centric means that pressing forward on the stick will drive the robot away from the driver on the field (toward the opposing field wall)
This won’t change even if the robot rotates
This relies on the robot knowing which way it is facing so it can correct for its own rotation when the driver wants it to move in a particular direction
This means that field-centric robots need an IMU (basically a gyro) to keep track of their rotation
Note that IMUs are relative. They actually track angular acceleration rather than angular position but are able to convert acceleration to position.
This means that similar to needing to tell an elevator when its at zero position and zeroing it, you will need to tell the robot what orientation it is in at the start of a match.
Ideally, you will also have a button to re-zero the robot orientation if needed
WPILib has also introduced a standard way to tell a drivetrain subsystem how to act
This is called a ChassisSpeeds object
The ChassisSpeeds object stores 3 values
X velocity (left right)
Y velocity (forward backward)
Omega (angular vel)
This information can be sent to the drivetrain as a command and received from the drivetrain as logged data
