# 2.6 Branches
Suppose you want to write the code for the robot intake  
A friend wants to write the code of the autonomous  
You both download local copies and work on code  
Now you both try to upload your local copies to the main repo  
Who’s copy wins?  
Whoever uploads first will get their code on the main codebase  
Whoever is second will get their change rejected to prevent overwriting person A’s change

Whoever uploads first will get their code on the main codebase  
Whoever is second will get their change rejected to prevent overwriting person A’s change  
The solution is branches  
Branches are variants of the main codebase for specific development  
These variants are also stored both on the cloud and on local machines  
It’s like timeline variants in the TV show Loki  
Now person A can create an “intake” branch for their work and Person B can make an “autonomous” branch for their’s  
Both people can develop independently on their own branches  
When they feel done, they can do a ‘merge’ back into the master branch (this will be explained later)  
You are currently in the “master” branch (the main development branch)  
At competition, the master branch is usually what's deployed to the robot  
To create a branch, click on where it says “master”  
Then click “create new branch”  
Name the branch your name  
Press the cloud button next to your name in the bottom left to upload it to Github  
Now everyone create a file called “[Your name].Java”  
Write an instance field and a constructor  
Make sure to save  
Check the third tab on the left for your change:  
Here is where you can review your changes before shipping them to the cloud codebase  
To push this change to the cloud version of your branch, hover over [Your Name].Java and press the little plus button  
This stages your change  
Now write a message specifying what change you made in the message box  
Press “Commit”  
Now the local copy of your GitHub branch on your computer has acknowledged your change, but we still haven’t gotten it to the cloud yet  
To push this change to the cloud version of your branch, hover over [Your Name].Java and press the little plus button  
This stages your change  
Now write a message specifying what change you made in the message box  
Press “Commit”  
Now the local copy of your GitHub branch on your computer has acknowledged your change, but we still haven’t gotten it to the cloud yet  
To push this change to the cloud version of your branch, hover over [Your Name].Java and press the little plus button  
This stages your change  
Now write a message specifying what change you made in the message box  
Press “Commit”  
Now the local copy of your GitHub branch on your computer has acknowledged your change, but we still haven’t gotten it to the cloud yet  
To push and pull from the cloud, press the little              next to the name of your branch  
Now go back to the GitHub repo  
Click the ‘branches’ button  
Open your branch  
You should see your changes  
Now we want to get those changes back into the master branch  
To do this, go to the ‘Pull Requests’ tab in GitHub  
The arrow indicates where to code is coming from and going to  
Make sure the one on the right is your branch  
Press “Create Pull Request”  
Name the pull request and give a description  
Usually, a teammate would look at your pull request by going to the pull request tab and clicking on your pull request  
Here they can review the history of that branch and make comments  
They can go to the “Files Changed” tab and look at everything that is different between the new branch and the master branch   
From here they can hover over a line of code and comment on it, starting a review  
If they are satisfied with the PR they can go to the main page and approve the changes and even make the merge happen  
The person merging should also delete the branch unless given other instructions by the owner of the branch  
After all, the development is done, there is no point in keeping the branch  
If you are working alone, press ‘Merge’. This will send your code to the main codebase. Then delete the new branch.  
If you are in a group, find a partner (or make a group of three)  
Review they’re changes  
If you are in a group, make sure everyone isn’t trying to merge into main all at once  
Have one person merge, then the next, and so on  
Each person should delete the branch they merge  
Now the master branch has everyone’s contributions
