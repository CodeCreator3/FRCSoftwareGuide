# 4 Advantage Kit/Scope
Before we run the mechanism, it is important to be able to read where the robot thinks the mechanism is
You could imagine that if you move the elevator an inch and the robot thinks it went 3 inches, it is probable that when you tell the elevator to go to 3 inches it will only go an inch
Basically we need to log the state of our mechanisms
One way we could read information from the robot is System.out.println()
This is used occasionally in FRC for niche purposes
However, you could imagine that constantly printing the current positions and velocities of different mechanisms over time to the constant would get extremely annoying
We need a way to graph these relationships in an organized fasion

There are a couple of solutions for this; the most popular of which is called ‘Advantage Scope’

Advantage Scope allows people to plot values like position and velocity on graphs so we can observe how they change over time in a neater format

However, Advantage Scope is far cooler than a graphing software, there are all sorts of ways you can visualize the information coming from your robot

For now, lets focus on graphing the position or velocity of our mechanism
Before we can do this, we need a way to get the information from the robot to our computer
The solution to this is called ‘NetworkTables’
You can almost think of network tables as a bulletin board that both your robot and your computer can post and read information from

Each sticky note has a name and a value (just like a variable)
In NetworkTables, these sticky notes are called ‘data entries’ or ‘logged data’
And in NetworkTables, these data entries are being updated many times a second
Advantage Scope shows you all of the data entries on Network Tables and lets you visualize them
Now the question is: how do we get the robot to post to Network Tables so we can read information on Advantage Scope?
