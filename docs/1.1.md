## 1.1 WPILib
- WPILib was created by WPI (Worchester Polytechnic Institute) through their partnership with FIRST Robotics
- The WPI Robotics Library (WPILib) is the standard software library provided for teams to write code for their FRC® robots. 
- WPILib contains a set of useful classes and subroutines for interfacing with various parts of the FRC control system (such as sensors, motor controllers, and the driver station), as well as an assortment of other utility functions.
- This is code that is written for us that will make our lives easier.
- WPILib has [documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) with a wealth of FRC Programming information.
